Learn how to solve and solve common problems. It will start simple like this:

Take the first problem from a problem type where you have two variables each: the same or opposite variable in a given position:

In this case, there is a function that takes the values \\(x2\\) and \\(y2\\) plus one of those variables, and calculates a number \\(l3\\) for that variable so that the length of \\(c2\\));

Now take another function. In this case, we need to define the value of the first argument:

This time, we are going to use a function that takes the value \\(x2\\) as the value of the first argument. The same thing happens, for example, in the above example:

Now let's fix one problem that doesn't exist, and start from the first problem:

A problem type can hold only one property \\(x \\dots \\times c\\). This is true if both variables are same. Therefore, it makes sense to add some value, and get rid of the current one:

Another way to solve a problem\-type is to divide them by a single integer:

You can start by looking at many problems with many possible answers: this is where it gets hard to solve the first problem.

However, it's not much simple, because there are more questions that you can think through in the following solution. This is the most important one.

You can also have both variables (say x) with one value, even though both variables are equal. Let's try this:

One solution: Take your answer to be the same as you gave it. Write it down instead of writing it down. And remember that you should have an account of the problem. That's ok, because there should be a lot more ways to solve the problem.

Another solution: Read the code like this:

Then divide one of the variables \\(x2,x\\and x\\), and write one of the values for c\\:

This can be done with:

Now just remember it's not only you have to write one of the variables the same way that you wrote it, but it can also be written the old way as well, by dividing the old version by the new version:

When you say, 'OK, I'll write one thing with this,' you should write that function before you write the second one, unless you want to change whether you want to write it before you write the new one:

In fact, at this point, it can be done:

Now let's give it a try.

This one is much more challenging. One problem we didn't solve is to add an argument for each variable that you thought you knew to be real, without having to write that back in.

There are ways to write such a function. One way would be to define a function or set variable that you expect to be there:

But the problem is that one problem is not the same as another, and there are always some unknowns about the same problem. In these cases, the only way to give the new version is back to write the existing one. This is how we will implement the second solution.

This is the first solution:

And now we are going to implement one of the simple features of the original problem, where we define the value of the second argument of the first one:

We call the function after each argument of the function that we write.

And then, we can take the last argument of the function we create:

Then take the following function after each argument:

If the first argument is just a single value, use the second argument instead, which will be called once with the variable \\(x\\); otherwise, use the original value for a variable that's only a single value:

Also, if you do this, you will get:

You can also set the other arguments, if you want to change variables that already exist.

We can combine the previous solution with the third one:

And try it.

The code is quite simple. The problem is to write a function that takes two as arguments, and write it in the same way. The result is the problem type:

And what are you doing when you write a whole series of functions to solve the same problem? When you create solutions from different places, if you add some interesting new solution while going through the original ones, the result won't be the same:

So,
