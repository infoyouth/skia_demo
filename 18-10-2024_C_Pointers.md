# C Pointers

Write a tutorial about C Pointers covering Introduction, Key Concepts, How to Use, Common Pitfalls, and Advanced Use Cases.

You do not need to do this homework to finish an introduction.

How to do the Intro: In this class you will learn how to demonstrate your understanding of C Pointers in a simplified setting with simple examples that you can work with on your own while still continuing to understand the concepts in context.

If you're already familiar with Java and C\+\+ programming concepts use this class to get a feel for the fundamentals and how to develop them while not over\-engineering your first implementation. Additionally you will learn how to create efficient applications using C Programming Principles, Key Concepts, and Examples. This is an excellent way to get a feel for the concepts and how to approach the code they provide.

The Code: Here you'll get a sense of this class. I used to write this class in the summer to fill up the gap left by Java 5, but recently Java 8 is now available for free at the web site jcenter. The class will be used for most things, like testing, to help you to understand the basic concepts in Java programming. In this class you will dive into the core concepts of C and its implementation through examples that walk you through each major aspect of the language.

You will also learn how the concepts are described, analyzed, and implemented. An example of my recent assignment of three values (a float, a float16, and a float32\) and a pointer to some values.

Once you've learned how the concepts are created you have the opportunity to build on them. As usual, my coding goals are to make it easy so that you know those concepts so you can make decisions about where to be in your future career.

I have my hands full with this class already, and I've designed it, so there is nothing to get lost in the writing. Use this class if you're new to Java and want to get a feel for how many great Java concepts there are out there for anyone to discover and use. This class was designed for programmers (just starting out) and programmers are welcome to create their own library to help build and learn how others get started and use Java concepts.

As I have said many times I am very curious how people would rate this class. When I first went to write this class I felt it didn't have high enough ratings to be suitable for most people. I thought it might fail the test of validity. I decided to try and make the best effort to produce something that was good and safe. If you have a great experience with this class you might want to give it a try.

There are many things that I like and need to know in this code so please feel free to include yours in any feedback. I will let you know if anything has not gotten me as excited as this is.

The Intro

JHG (JHC: "Java Language and Computer Graphics") was designed by Greg Beeson that I made at my own expense when I was working on creating the tutorial and a project at my studio that involved a lot of homework. I wanted my tutorial to be a little long to try and simplify so that I could focus more on the fun aspects of programming. This class is my attempt at making this something I could write quickly and get more done.

The code is generated by the compiler with a class of the type Java.java which is based on the current C implementation. When I first created it it was based on an earlier version of a class I wrote back in 2005\. It turned out to be quite a bit of work for a school\-level example. I am very sorry we had to put up with it and I was able to write a simple test for creating a class and implementing it without much work. The class is pretty simple: first, put the class from java on a stack of 8\. This creates a new instance of java.lang.Class. Later, I wrote my own implementation of the implementation at my studio and applied the same logic to create and implement a simple example which took 2 minutes and 10 seconds to complete.

I have no idea how it will function and if I can make it the most popular class when it's written. However, it will probably turn out very well. I am not sure I can continue to improve the class just from the initial creation. While I hope this class and the others I wrote will continue to have some form of popularity it's simply out of my hands. Many people like to code in Java and Java. My goal is that in the future it is the easiest type to use. This class is as good for learning Java as any other code.

The code will be very straightforward and easy to get up and playing with. It is based off of the core classes Java
